An already running PostgreSQL is assumed.

To create the database, connect to the PostgreSQL server
using a database role who has CREATEDB priviledge (or as superuser),
and execute the commands in db-create.sql file.  For example:

  su - postgres
  psql -q -f db-create.sql -v dbName=users

You can specify the database name in the dbName variable above.
If you choose another than 'users', remember to change it in
commands that follow.

Then, you can connect to the newly created database and
create the database objects in it.  For example:

  # still as 'postgres' operating system user
  psql -q -f db-types-create.sql users

Note that the database and the objects in it should NOT be owned by
any of the roles that will be used by the software.  Some
database administrative role is better suited for the owner.

To give minimum needed priviledges to the software, first
create a separate database role for it.  For example:

  # still as 'postgres' operating system user, or another database
  # role that has CREATEROLE priviledge.
  psql -q -f role-create.sql -v rolename=user-service -v password=password

You can specify the role name in the rolename variable above.
If you choose another that 'user-service', remember to change it in the
commands below.  Similarly, you should set a good password in the
password variable above.

Then connect to the database and grant the needed
priviledges.  For example:

  # still as 'postgres' operating system user
  psql -q -f role-grant.sql -v rolename=user-service users

Optionally, to fill the database with some test data, issue a command:

  psql -q -f test-insert.sql users user-service

Note that this should be done as recycloid role, just as the recycloid
software would do.
